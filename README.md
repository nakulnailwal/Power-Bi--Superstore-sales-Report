This Power BI project provides an interactive Superstore Sales Report to analyze key metrics such as sales, profit, and order trends. The data was cleaned, modeled into relational tables, and enhanced with DAX measures to calculate KPIs like total sales, profit margin, and region-wise performance. Visualizations include category-wise sales, top-performing products, and geographic insights.
